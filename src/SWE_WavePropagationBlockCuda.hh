/**
 * SWE_WavePropagationBlockCuda is an implementation of the SWE_BlockCuda abstract class.
 * It uses a wave propagation solver which is defined with the pre-compiler flag WAVE_PROPAGATION_SOLVER (see above).
 *
 * Possible wave propagation solvers are:
 *  F-Wave, <strike>Approximate Augmented Riemann, Hybrid (f-wave + augmented).</strike>
 *  (details can be found in the corresponding source files)
