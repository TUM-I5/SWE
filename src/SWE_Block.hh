/**
 * SWE_Block is the main data structure to compute our shallow water model 
 * on a single Cartesian grid block:
 * SWE_Block is an abstract class (and interface) that should be extended 
 * by respective implementation classes.
 *
 * <h3>Cartesian Grid for Discretization:</h3>
 * 
 * SWE_Blocks uses a regular Cartesian grid of size #nx by #ny, where each 
 * grid cell carries three unknowns:
 * - the water level #h 
 * - the momentum components #hu and #hv (in x- and y- direction, resp.)
 * - the bathymetry #b
 * 
 * Each of the components is stored as a 2D array, implemented as a Float2D object, 
 * and are defined on grid indices [0,..,#nx+1]*[0,..,#ny+1]. 
 * The computational domain is indexed with [1,..,#nx]*[1,..,#ny].
 * 
 * The mesh sizes of the grid in x- and y-direction are stored in static variables 
 * #dx and #dy. The position of the Cartesian grid in space is stored via the 
 * coordinates of the left-bottom corner of the grid, in the variables 
 * #offsetX and #offsetY.
 * 
 * <h3>Ghost layers:</h3>
 * 
 * To implement the behaviour of the fluid at boundaries and for using 
 * multiple block in serial and parallel settings, SWE_Block adds an 
 * additional layer of so-called ghost cells to the Cartesian grid, 
 * as illustrated in the following figure.
 * Cells in the ghost layer have indices 0 or #nx+1 / #ny+1.
 *
 * \image html ghost_cells.gif
 * 
 * <h3>Memory Model:</h3>
 * 
 * The variables #h, #hu, #hv for water height and momentum will typically be  
 * updated by classes derived from SWE_Block. However, it is not assumed that 
 * such and updated will be performed in every time step. 
 * Instead, subclasses are welcome to update #h, #hu, and #hv in a lazy fashion, 
 * and keep data in faster memory (incl. local memory of acceleration hardware, 
 * such as GPGPUs), instead. 
 *
 * It is assumed that the bathymetry data #b is not changed during the algorithm
 * (up to the exceptions mentioned in the following). 
 * 
 * To force a synchronization of the respective data structures, the following 
 * methods are provided as part of SWE_Block:
 * - synchAfterWrite() to synchronize #h, #hu, #hv, and #b after an external update 
 *   (reading a file, e.g.);
 * - synchWaterHeightAfterWrite(), synchDischargeAfterWrite(), synchBathymetryAfterWrite():
 *   to synchronize only #h or momentum (#hu and #hv) or bathymetry #b;
 * - synchGhostLayerAfterWrite() to synchronize only the ghost layers
 * - synchBeforeRead() to synchronize #h, #hu, #hv, and #b before an output of the 
 *   variables (writing a visualization file, e.g.)
 * - synchWaterHeightBeforeRead(), synchDischargeBeforeRead(), synchBathymetryBeforeRead():
 *   as synchBeforeRead(), but only for the specified variables
 * - synchCopyLayerBeforeRead(): synchronizes the copy layer only (i.e., a layer that 
 *   is to be replicated in a neighbouring SWE_Block.
 *
 * <h3>Derived Classes</h3>
 *
 * As SWE_Block just provides an abstract base class together with the most 
 * important data structures, the implementation of concrete models is the 
 * job of respective derived classes (see the class diagram at the top of this 
 * page). Similar, parallel implementations that are based on a specific 
 * parallel programming model (such as OpenMP) or parallel architecture 
 * (such as GPU/CUDA) should form subclasses of their own. 
 * Please refer to the documentation of these classes for more details on the 
 * model and on the parallelisation approach.
