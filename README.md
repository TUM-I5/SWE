## General Information

This code has been tested under Ubuntu 22.04 or higher. Other Linux distributions will probably work.
However, we do not recommend using Windows or MacOS.
If you do not have Linux installed on your computer, please use WSL, Virtual Machine, Docker or similar.

## Docker

A prebuilt Docker image is available in [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tumi5/swe).

To use the prebuilt image, we do recommended that you first clone SWE, then navigate into the SWE checkout
and run the Docker container interactively by mapping the SWE1D directory into the container (here, we use `work` as our mapping point):

```shell
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/work --rm --privileged tumi5/swe /bin/bash
```

## Build and Test

As build system configurator we use CMake. To compile the code execute the following commands in this directory:

* Create a build directory: `mkdir build`. You can also choose any other name for your build directory.
* Switch to this directory: `cd build`
* Run CMake: `cmake ..` (For an overview of all available options, use `ccmake ..`)
* Run Make: `make` (or `make -j` to compile with multiple cores).
* Run Tests: Some example unit tests have been implemented (`make test`). Feel free to add your own test cases inside the `Tests` folder.

## Running a Simulation

* Run the code in serial via `./SWE-MPI-Runner`
* Run the code in parallel via `mpirun -np nproc ./SWE-MPI-Runner`
* With `./SWE-MPI-Runner --help`, you can see additional command-line arguments you can pass.

## Visualize the Results

The command line version of SWE will write a netCDF file or multiple ASCII-VTK files (depending on the build configuration) which can be opened and visualized with ParaView.

**Hint:** The output files contain the absolute height of the water column _h_. To get the relative height of the water column, use a _Calculator_ in ParaView with the formula `h+b`. If you have dry cells in your scenario, you may want to use the formula `min(h, h+b)`. This will give you the relative height for wet cells and 0 for dry cells.

Besides the [VTKWriter](/Source/Writers/VTKWriter.hpp), SWE is also able to write [netCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files. You can enable the [NetCDFWriter](/Source/Writers/NetCDFWriter.hpp) with the CMake option `-DENABLE_NETCDF=ON`. It is enabled per default.

The [NetCDFWriter](Source/Writers/NetCDFWriter.hpp) has two advantages:

* It creates binary files and is therefore faster to read and write.
* All time steps are stored in a single file.

The [NetCDFWriter](Source/Writers/NetCDFWriter.hpp) respects the COARDS standard, thus you can also visualize the netCDF files with ParaView.

## Adding New Source Files

You can add new source files by just creating them somewhere within the `Source` folder. CMake automatically detects these files and adds them to the build.

## Creating Doxygen Documentation

* Navigate into the SWE1D directory
* Run the following Doxygen command: `doxygen Documentation/Doxyfile`
* You should now see a directory called `html`
* Open `index.html` to see the generated documentation.

## Development Hints & FAQ

### It does not compile and everything seems fine?

Make sure to use `make clean` before you use `make`. Sometimes there are build artifacts from previous build processes that spoil your current compilation process. `make clean` takes care of deleting everything that should not be there and allows the compiler to start from scratch.

Sometimes it is also helpful to delete the `build` folder and create a new one, following the steps from the compilation section above.

### How can I see all the compiler flags the generated Makefile is using?

Instead of using `make`, run `VERBOSE=1 make`. You can also run `make -n` to invoke a dry run where you see what the Makefile would do in case of compilation.

### How can I see the test output?

Instead of using `make test`, run `ctest --verbose`.
