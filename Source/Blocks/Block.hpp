  /**
   * Blocks::Block is the main data structure to compute our shallow water model
   * on a single Cartesian grid block:
   * Blocks::Block is an abstract class (and interface) that should be extended
   * by respective implementation classes.
   *
   * <h3>Cartesian Grid for Discretization:</h3>
   *
   * Blocks::Block uses a regular Cartesian grid of size #nx by #ny, where each
   * grid cell carries three unknowns:
   * - the water level #h
   * - the momentum components #hu and #hv (in x- and y- direction, resp.)
   * - the bathymetry #b
   *
   * Each of the components is stored as a 2D array, implemented as a Tools::Float2D object,
   * and are defined on grid indices [0,..,#nx+1]*[0,..,#ny+1].
   * The computational domain is indexed with [1,..,#nx]*[1,..,#ny].
   *
   * The mesh sizes of the grid in x- and y-direction are stored in static variables
   * #dx and #dy. The position of the Cartesian grid in space is stored via the
   * coordinates of the left-bottom corner of the grid, in the variables
   * #offsetX and #offsetY.
   *
   * <h3>Ghost layers:</h3>
   *
   * To implement the behaviour of the fluid at boundaries and for using
   * multiple block in serial and parallel settings, Blocks::Block adds an
   * additional layer of so-called ghost cells to the Cartesian grid,
   * as illustrated in the following figure.
   * Cells in the ghost layer have indices 0 or #nx+1 / #ny+1.
   *
   * \image html ghost_cells.gif
   *
   * <h3>Memory Model:</h3>
   *
   * The variables #h, #hu, #hv for water height and momentum will typically be
   * updated by classes derived from Blocks::Block. However, it is not assumed that
   * such and updated will be performed in every time step.
   * Instead, subclasses are welcome to update #h, #hu, and #hv in a lazy fashion,
   * and keep data in faster memory (incl. local memory of acceleration hardware,
   * such as GPGPUs), instead.
   *
   * It is assumed that the bathymetry data #b is not changed during the algorithm
   * (up to the exceptions mentioned in the following).
   *
   * To force a synchronization of the respective data structures, the following
   * methods are provided as part of Blocks::Block:
   * - synchAfterWrite() to synchronize #h, #hu, #hv, and #b after an external update
   *   (reading a file, e.g.);
   * - synchWaterHeightAfterWrite(), synchDischargeAfterWrite(), synchBathymetryAfterWrite():
   *   to synchronize only #h or momentum (#hu and #hv) or bathymetry #b;
   * - synchGhostLayerAfterWrite() to synchronize only the ghost layers
   * - synchBeforeRead() to synchronize #h, #hu, #hv, and #b before an output of the
   *   variables (writing a visualization file, e.g.)
   * - synchWaterHeightBeforeRead(), synchDischargeBeforeRead(), synchBathymetryBeforeRead():
   *   as synchBeforeRead(), but only for the specified variables
   * - synchCopyLayerBeforeRead(): synchronizes the copy layer only (i.e., a layer that
   *   is to be replicated in a neighbouring Blocks::Block.
   *
   * <h3>Derived Classes</h3>
   *
   * As Blocks::Block just provides an abstract base class together with the most
   * important data structures, the implementation of concrete models is the
   * job of respective derived classes (see the class diagram at the top of this
   * page). Similar, parallel implementations that are based on a specific
   * parallel programming model (such as OpenMP) or parallel architecture
   * (such as GPU/CUDA) should form subclasses of their own.
   * Please refer to the documentation of these classes for more details on the
   * model and on the parallelisation approach.
